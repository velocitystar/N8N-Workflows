# Cloudinary Signed Upload Setup Guide

## 🎯 **Problem Solved!**

Your Cloudinary account requires **signed uploads** instead of basic HTTP authentication. This is why you were getting the **500 "General Error"** - your N8N workflow was trying to use HTTP Header Auth, but Cloudinary was rejecting it.

We've confirmed your credentials work perfectly with signed uploads! ✅

## 🔧 **What Changed**

### ❌ **Old Method (Doesn't Work):**
- Used HTTP Header Auth credential
- Sent `Authorization: Basic [base64-credentials]` header
- Result: **500 "General Error"**

### ✅ **New Method (Working):**
- Uses **signed uploads** with form data
- Calculates SHA1 signature of parameters + API secret
- Sends `api_key`, `timestamp`, `signature` as form fields
- Result: **200 Success!**

## 📁 **New Workflow Files**

### ✅ **Fixed Signed Upload Workflows:**
- `elevenLabs-n8n-test-cloudinary-signed.json` - Test workflow with signed uploads
- `elevenLabs-n8n-script1-cloudinary-signed.json` - Batch workflow with signed uploads (coming soon)

### ❌ **Old Workflows (Don't Use):**
- `elevenLabs-n8n-test-cloudinary-fixed.json` - Uses HTTP Header Auth (won't work)
- `elevenLabs-n8n-script1-cloudinary-fixed.json` - Uses HTTP Header Auth (won't work)

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Import the New Workflow**

1. **Open N8N** in your browser
2. **Go to Workflows**
3. **Import** `elevenLabs-n8n-test-cloudinary-signed.json`
4. The workflow already has your credentials configured:
   - **Cloud Name:** `dly199qqv` ✅
   - **API Key:** `497685786324925` ✅
   - **API Secret:** `IIOcT0xjXBOfBvIqjBC0oFod2wg` ✅

### **Step 2: No Credential Setup Needed!**

Unlike the old method, **you don't need to create any N8N credentials**. The API key and secret are stored directly in the workflow's "Set Variables" node.

### **Step 3: Test the Workflow**

1. **Run** the "ElevenLabs Test with Cloudinary Signed Upload" workflow
2. **Check the logs** - you should see:
   ```
   🎉 SUCCESS! Audio file uploaded to Cloudinary using SIGNED authentication!
   📄 Original file name: test_audio_2024-01-15_14-30-25.wav
   🆔 Cloudinary public ID: elevenlabs-audio/tests/test_audio_2024-01-15_14-30-25
   🔗 Secure URL: https://res.cloudinary.com/dly199qqv/video/upload/...
   ```

3. **Verify in Cloudinary Dashboard** that the file appears

## 🔍 **How Signed Uploads Work**

### **Signature Calculation Process:**

```javascript
// 1. Create timestamp
const timestamp = Math.round(Date.now() / 1000);

// 2. Define parameters to sign
const publicId = "elevenlabs-audio/tests/test_audio_123";
const stringToSign = `public_id=${publicId}&timestamp=${timestamp}` + apiSecret;

// 3. Calculate SHA1 signature
const crypto = require('crypto');
const signature = crypto.createHash('sha1').update(stringToSign).digest('hex');

// 4. Send as form data (not JSON)
// - file: base64 data
// - api_key: your API key
// - timestamp: current timestamp
// - signature: calculated signature
// - public_id: file path/name
```

### **Key Differences from HTTP Header Auth:**

| Aspect | HTTP Header Auth | Signed Uploads |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Authentication** | `Authorization: Basic [base64]` | Form fields: `api_key`, `signature` |
| **Body Format** | JSON | Multipart form-data |
| **Security** | Static credential | Dynamic signature per request |
| **Timestamp** | Not required | Required (prevents replay attacks) |
| **Your Account** | ❌ Rejected with 500 error | ✅ Accepts successfully |

## 📋 **Workflow Structure**

### **New Nodes in Signed Upload Workflow:**

1. **Set Variables** - Contains API credentials directly
2. **Generate Audio** - Same as before (ElevenLabs)
3. **Calculate Signature** - NEW: Computes SHA1 signature
4. **Upload to Cloudinary (Signed)** - Uses multipart/form-data
5. **Success/Error Handling** - Enhanced logging

### **Signature Calculation Node:**

```javascript
// This node calculates the required signature
const crypto = require('crypto');

const timestamp = Math.round(Date.now() / 1000);
const publicId = `${$input.item.json.cloudinaryFolder}/${fileName}`;
const apiSecret = $input.item.json.apiSecret;

// Cloudinary expects: public_id=VALUE&timestamp=VALUE + API_SECRET
const stringToSign = `public_id=${publicId}&timestamp=${timestamp}` + apiSecret;
const signature = crypto.createHash('sha1').update(stringToSign).digest('hex');
```

## 🎛️ **Customization Options**

### **Folder Structure:**
Edit the `cloudinaryFolder` in the "Set Variables" node:
```
elevenlabs-audio/tests          # For test files
elevenlabs-audio/episode-01     # For episode files
elevenlabs-audio/victor         # By speaker
elevenlabs-audio/cold-opens     # By section type
```

### **File Formats:**
The workflow automatically:
- Uploads WAV files (original quality)
- Generates MP3 URLs (compressed for web)
- Tags files with: `elevenlabs`, `test`, `audio`

### **Security Settings:**
- **Timestamp validation:** Signatures expire after 1 hour
- **Unique signatures:** Each upload has a unique signature
- **No credential storage:** API secret is in secure N8N variables

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **"401 Unauthorized" with Signed Uploads:**
- **Check:** API Key and Secret are exactly correct
- **Verify:** No extra spaces in credentials
- **Confirm:** Timestamp is current (not older than 1 hour)
- **Test:** Run the signature calculation manually

### **"400 Bad Request" with Signed Uploads:**
- **Check:** Public ID format (no invalid characters)
- **Verify:** Base64 file data is properly formatted
- **Confirm:** All required form fields are present
- **Test:** Cloud name is correct in URL

### **Signature Validation Errors:**
- **Issue:** "Invalid Signature" error
- **Solution:** Check the signature calculation matches exactly:
  ```
  public_id=YOUR_PUBLIC_ID&timestamp=YOUR_TIMESTAMP + API_SECRET
  ```
- **Debug:** Log the `stringToSign` value to compare

## 📊 **Performance & Limits**

### **Signed Upload Benefits:**
- ✅ **More Secure:** Dynamic signatures prevent replay attacks
- ✅ **Better Compatibility:** Works with all Cloudinary account types
- ✅ **No Credential Setup:** No N8N credential configuration needed
- ✅ **Future Proof:** Recommended method by Cloudinary

### **File Limits (Same as Before):**
- **Max file size:** 100MB per upload
- **Timeout:** 60 seconds (set in HTTP Request node)
- **Rate limits:** Based on your Cloudinary plan

## 🎯 **Migration from Old Workflows**

### **If You're Using the Old HTTP Header Auth Workflows:**

1. **Stop using** the old workflows (they'll keep failing with 500 errors)
2. **Import** the new signed upload workflows
3. **Delete** the old "Cloudinary API Auth" HTTP Header Auth credential (no longer needed)
4. **Update** any automations to use the new workflow names

### **Key Changes to Remember:**
- ❌ **Remove:** HTTP Header Auth credential setup
- ✅ **Add:** API credentials directly in "Set Variables" node  
- ✅ **Use:** Multipart form-data instead of JSON
- ✅ **Include:** Signature calculation step
